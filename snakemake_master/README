## LAUNCH SNAKEMAKE MODULES 
# launch respective SNAKEMAKE jobs from within the working directory containing all three files (Snakefile, cluster.slurm.json, snakemakeslurm.sh) and the samples file (see below) with following command line:
mkdir -p logs
sbatch --mem=2000 -o logs/0master.log -c 1 --job-name='SM.master' --time 5-00:00:00 -p defq,sched_mem1TB_centos7 --wrap="\
 bash snakemakeslurm.sh ; "

### SAMPLES.CSV FORMAT
# The csv file has to be in the working directory of each respective snakemake run
## MAPPING
# File Name: samples.csv
# Format/Header: Path,Sample,ReferenceGenome,ProviderName,Subject
# Path: folder where raw sequencing data in gz format is stored for each sample (using the ProviderName). NOTE: Path requires trailing "/"!
# samples that have been sequenced twice are merged when ProviderName is the same
# ReferenceGenome: Folder name in /scratch/mit_lieberman/reference_genomes. Different samples can have different reference genomes.
## CASE
# File Name: samples_case.csv
# Format: Path,Sample,ReferenceGenome,Outgroup
# Path: points to working directory from mapping step. NOTE: No trailing "/"!
# ReferenceGenome: Folder name in /scratch/mit_lieberman/reference_genomes.
# Only single reference genome is allowed per case step.
